## Description
On this website you can see a variety of products, filter by categories and add to your favorites products you like or add to the cart products you are interested in purchasing.
A checkout page is still under construction, so it is not possible to switch to a payment page at this stage (it is not part of the project requirements..)
By clicking on a product you can see the extended details and add to the cart.
If you log in as an admin user, you can add / edit / delete products
